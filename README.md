# ERC20_FirstToken: EmurielToken (EMD)  

Welcome to the repository for **EmurielToken (EMD)**, my first ERC20-compliant cryptocurrency! 🚀 This project is a hands-on exploration of Solidity, smart contracts, and the DeFi ecosystem.  

---

## 📜 Overview  

EmurielToken (EMD) is a custom ERC20 token deployed on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) testnet. This project was built using OpenZeppelin's ERC20 implementation to ensure a secure and efficient smart contract.  

In addition, a mock USDC token (MockUSDC) was deployed to simulate real-world trading scenarios. EMD was then listed on PancakeSwap, where liquidity was provided using MockUSDC to enable buying and selling.

## 🚀 Features  

- **ERC20 Standard**: Implements the standard functions and events defined by the ERC20 specification.  
- **Mock Token Deployment**: Simulates USDC for liquidity and trading experiments.  
- **Liquidity Provision**: Adds liquidity to PancakeSwap for trading.  
- **Secure Implementation**: Built with OpenZeppelin’s trusted libraries.
